# DTMFSignalProcessinginMatlab
Matlab Files and Report for DTMF Signal Generation and Decode.
The File is created under Chinese Language environment several years ago in my undergraduate course Digital Signal Processing.
The whole application contains one .m file for code and one .fig file for GUI.
There are some messy code caused by different language environments, several times zip/unzip, upload/download (whatever).
If you are interested in it, feel free to contact me for help. :)
